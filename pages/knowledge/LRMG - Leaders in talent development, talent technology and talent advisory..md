## What Our Client Say About Us

We are excited to partner with LRMG on culture transformation, leadership development and employee engagement. Their understanding of our industry and business, their thought leadership and ability to develop bespoke solutions, and unwavering commitment to service excellence is what I value most.

Nedbank is commited to the growth and development of its people and the transformation of its skill profile. Ongoing upskilling and reskilling is not only a talent strategy but is important and business-critical to ensure a future-ready workforce. Our partnership with LRMG and EdCast helps us achieve this.

The manner in which you curated the multipronged development journey with us –the Internal Audit team and their acceleration to become digitally fluent as a function at pace as example, relentlessly absorbed our constructive feedback and many iterations later, delivered a bespoke journey suitable to our needs that translated from a boardroom exercise to live agile learning for our teams and 100% graduation of the class during a merger and just off the back of a pandemic – speaks for itself.

My experience of working with LRMG has been extremely positive. The manner of engagement has always been professional and on point. The journey that we have been on has had a profound impact on the leaders in CASC and we are very appreciative and the time, effort and dedication of the entire LRMG team. They have demonstrated flexibility and an agile mindset, and that resonates quite closely with the journey that we have embarked on as CASC. LRMG’s agile mindset and the ability to pivot unexpectedly and still deliver world class outcomes. If LRMG were a sports team, they’d be the champions consistently over a long period of time.

We selected LRMG to be one of our partners in our quest to develop talent and invest in our people at Santam. We designed a fun and immersive concept to ‘pick up our Graduates and fly them to a new destination’ – effectively landing them in the business. We have crew members, pilots, support staff – a team of people ready to support, guide and lead our new grads on their journey.

We chose IT Talent (LRMG) because you did not say you will do everything right but partner with us for growth. You spoke about your agility when it comes to learning solutions and we loved your absolute honesty.

The LRMG sales training has been a game changer for us in many ways. Firstly, we have seen with our own internal training and coaching, modelled on the LRMG method, that all agents are growing in confidence week on week, and they are taking that back onto the battlefield. Secondly, our sales numbers are improving tremendously. Since we completed the training in December, we have seen January to be our highest sales number achieved since June last year, and February looks like it’s going to be even higher!! Lastly, on an individual level, I have grown personally and professionally and thoroughly enjoyed the entire process. The Gamification is amazing and makes the training even more enjoyable. Thanks to the LRMG team for the awesome coaching!

We are not just managing talent technology for Moyo and leaving the rest to the technical team; HR has been invited in as partners and contributors.
